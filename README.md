# One Minute Ambulance

The Ambulance Booking Service in India is still largely based on the calling of '102' helpline, but there are many problems with this process: 
1) The time to note down details by call operator, to provide driver the details, for the driver to have navigation takes a lot of time that can be critical 
2)  102 only has the 'Basic Life Support' category of ambulances available which lack many medical equipments and render them ineffective for critical situations such as neo-natal care or multiple victims or ventilators requirement or blood transfusion.
3) The 102 only has govt ambulances, so private ambulance even if nearby cannot be booked via 102. 
4) The lack of availability because of large area coverage in less ambulance volume 
5) No communication about the patient medical history to the first responders available. Ex: heart Conditions, meds, blood group etc

Our Solution is to provide an open platform app which allows boarding of both private and govt players to provide ambulance service. 
The App allows for user to see all ambulances in real time in 10kms vicinity and of which type they are - Basic Life Support, Critical Care, Govt Ambulance, Neo Natal Care, MVA etc.
It records the patient details on registration and can transfer it to the first responders at the time of booking. 
Driver will be able to see location of user in real time. App auto detects the user location, no need to type the address. 
All of the booking process can be done in under 1 minute !
